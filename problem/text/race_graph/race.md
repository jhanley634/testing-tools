# Moore's law

Things are no longer getting faster,
just denser.

# Thermal management -- heat

More bit flips means more $I^2 R$ heating

# Delay encoding

There's more than one way to store small integers.

"The key idea behind race logic is to encode values as a _delay_ from some reference."


# Computing with delay encoding

"basic temporal operators MAX, MIN, and ADD-CONSTANT ...
efficiently solve a class of dynamic programming algorithms"

# Reverse race trees

A decision tree, e.g. an XGBoost model,
can be implemented as a tree of signals racing from leaves to root.

At each node the first arriving signal wins, with others suppressed.

# end-to-end architecture

4.1. From sensor to delay coded input

"Because sensory input is analog in nature, most sensors begin with
a measured voltage or current, which is then converted to a digital
output with the use of ADCs.
ADCs traditionally return digital binary values; however, given that
information in the time domain is now useful for computation, the
design of these components can be significantly simplified.
For instance, the costly time-to-digital conversion (TDC) in the ADCs
is redundant and can be skipped.
Examples of sensing systems that can provide directly time-encoded
outputs, without TDCs, include

1. Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS),
2. Asynchronous Time-based Image Sensors (ATIS),
3. Time To First Spike (TTFS) and
4. Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras, and
5. AER (Address Event Representation) Ear2 sound sensors."


# Implementation

"We also build a Python-based development flow,
which attaches to the popular scikit-learn library and leverages the
power of hardware templates and PyRTL -- a Python embedded hardware
design language -- to generate synthesizable RTL code.
More specifically, once the model is trained, the tool analyzes the
importance of input features, explores the learnersâ€™ performance
against lower resolution data, proceeds with votes quantization,
generates either a customized hardware design or a configuration file,
and performs cross-checking verification.
To obtain the desired implementation results, we use open-source tools
and a publicly available 14 nm standard cell library.
The operational voltage and frequency are 0.55 V and 1,000 MHz, respectively."
