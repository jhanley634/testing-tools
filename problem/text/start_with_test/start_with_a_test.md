# Start with a test!

## hello

You have been writing code for some little while at this point.

Does it tend to start like this?

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {

        puts("Hello world!")

    }

(implicit declaration of function 'puts' is invalid in C99)


# hello

Or like this?

    print("Hello world!")

More verbosely:

    def main():
        print("Hello world!")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
